## Week 1
This week I took around 4 to 5 hours to learn about Swift through the videos from "100 Days of SwiftUI". I watched the videos and took notes accordingly and I went from not knowing Swift to being somewhat knowledgable about it. As of now I only went through days 1 to 7 but I'll continue with it afterwards. 

This week's assignment, I created a project called "Fishes" which is a simple artwork made of symbols and a bubble emoji that represents the underwater environment. I used a minimal amount of emoji, but a function that I did incorporate was randomizing the position of the emoji every time the user refreshes the page. Since this is a primarily easy first project that I started with, I didn't come upon any issues.
